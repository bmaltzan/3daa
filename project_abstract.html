<font size=3 face="Arial">
<p>3D Algorithm Animator (3DAA) has been implemented as a Java applet that allows 
a user to visualize an algorithm.

<p>The current version of 3DAA simulates a raytracer. Some of the important features are:
The user can render an image of a scene. 
The user can create, modify, or select a scene.
The path of a ray can be recorded. 
An animated 3D wireframe of the ray and scene can be coordinated with a code walk-through, 
  showing how a pixel's color is determined in the rendered image. 
The values of variables can be displayed.

<p>The 3DAA simulator has been implemented in a way that makes it relatively easy
to include multiple 3D algorithms.
