<font size=3 face="Arial">

<p>3DAA is a tool, available across most platforms, that allows Computer Science
students to increase their depth and rate of understanding of an algorithm by
interacting with that algorithm in multiple ways: 
viewing source code, 
modifying algorithm input, 
and vcr-like control over an animation of the algorithm in execution.

<p>3DAA is written in Java. Java is platform-independent, and as an applet,
can be run on any platform with a supporting browser, with no other setup or installation. 


<p>A Raytracer was implemented as an algorithm to simulate, as in its predecessor.
A vector can be followed through a scene, showing the interaction between a ray
cast into a scene, objects, and light sources. Depending on the interaction
(reflection, transparency, object interesection), the vectors will be displayed in 
different colors. 3dAA extends some of this functionality. It allows a user
to select a pixel in the resulting image to trace the vector. 
After recording, values of variables are displayed as the algorithm is played back.
The ability to select the data the algorithm takes as input for execution is also
added. The user can graphically create a scene to be raytraced.

<p>3DAA is designed to allow multiple algorithms to be simulated. Algorithms
are easily incorporated through object-oriented reuse and inheritance. Its
existing framework allows a minimal amount of simulation related code to be written.
