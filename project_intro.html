<font size=3 face="Arial"><p>
The goal of this project is to create a tool that will allow
programmers to quickly gain an in-depth understanding of an algorithm.

<p>Learning an algorithm through a simulator has many advantages.
The algorithm code can be presented in a more managable way. Psuedocode
allows the user to focus on the problem being solved. Implementation
overhead can be ignored, while a working system is available for testing. 
The user can enter data as input to the algorithm through a graphical
interface, giving the user a more concrete and easier way to understand
what the algorithm is processing. Most important, the user can also 
simulate the execution of the algorithm. As the algorithm is executed,
it can present multiple views of the algorithm: source code, images, animations,
and values of variables. This allows the user to focus on the algorithm and
visualize how it works, without spending time searching for called procedures
and calculating values.

<p>3dAA is implemented as a Java applet. This allows any user with 
Internet access and a web browser to run a simulation.
