<p>In the pref panel, there is a panel allowing the user to modify the 
font size. This is an inner class, part of Sim. Adjusting this will modify
the text size of all text objects that the Sim class has direct access to.
These include about, help, and code panels.

<p>The Debugging Panel is another inner class, and part of Sim. It has one
feature, it will determine the total and available memory, and print this
in the message box at the top of the applet.
