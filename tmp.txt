Abstract

A Java applet allows the user to move forward and backward through the code for a 
ray tracer.  As the code is being viewed, the output can be seen in a separate 
window.  In another window, a wireframe model of objects in the scene being 
rendered is shown, and from a convenient viewpoint, demonstrates ray interaction 
with objects and light sources.

The scene can be chosen using a setup screen.  Object position, sizes, and 
colors can be set.  Point light position and color can also be set.

The applet can be viewed in any browser supporting Java 1.1, or run with JDK1.1.6.

Features:
 Code window, highlights line currently executing in the simulation.
 Output window, displays portion of the scene rendered.
 Vector guided view window, animates wireframe objects and light rays.
 Setup window, configures scene to be rendered.
 Mouse click on output window selects pixel to ray trace.
 Output window zooming.
 Design allows for other 3d algorithms to be easily incorporated.
 Thread to provide fast response time to user commands.
 Forward, Reverse, and Stop, VCR-like controls.
 Speed control for code, and wireframe animation.

 Hardware support (Magician OpenGL) in setup and vector guided view windows.
 Variable values displayed
